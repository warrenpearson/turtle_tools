### Turtle capabilities to test

```python
# my_turtle4.setposition(150,0)
# my_turtle4.color('black')
# my_turtle4.setheading(270)
# my_turtle.backward(50)
# my_turtle.right(60)
# my_turtle.left(60)
# pensize
# up and down
```

### Programming basics

* while loop
    * make it easy to repeat movements
    * maybe draw a square
    * write a function to draw a square

* if statement
    * avoid edges (figure out window size, set initial position)
 
* turtle_food.py
    * make the turtle get bigger the more he eats
